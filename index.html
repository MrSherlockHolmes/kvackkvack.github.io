    <h1>Hi.</h1>
    <p>My name is Arthur. I prefer not to give out my last name. Online, I call myself kvackkvack. I prefer not to give out my password.</p>

  <div class = "textbox" id="me>
    <h1>Me.</h1>
    <p>I'm a 12 year old boy. I love programming. I like a lot of things. I dislike about the same amount of things. I made this website, mostly to host any JS projects I decide to make.</p>  
  </div>
  <div class = "textbox" id="projects">
    <h1>JS Projects ???</h1>
    <p>Yes. You can check those out <a href="/projects">here</a> or in the topbar. Depending on when you're viewing this, though, that page may not contain anything really interesting.</p>  
  </div>
  <div class = "textbox" id="about">
    <h1>Hm. Are those projects everything you've done in your whole life?</h1>
    <p><a href="/about">No</a>. I exist in other places, too, and I like other things too. You really should check out that topbar, you know.</p>
