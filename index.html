<h1>Me.</h1>
<p>I'm a 12 year old boy. I love programming. I like a lot of things. I dislike about the same amount of things. I made this website, mostly to host any JS projects I decide to make.</p>

<div class = "textbox">
<h1>JS Projects ?</h1>
<p>Yes. You can check those out <a href="/projects">here</a>. Depending on when you're viewing this, though, that page might be empty.</p>
