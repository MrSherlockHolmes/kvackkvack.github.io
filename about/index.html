    <p>I exist in other places too. Namely on my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/kvackkvack/">Scratch Account</a>. 
    Scratch is a children's programming website, but it can be pretty great for older people too. 
    I'd recommend checking out the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/31/">Advanced Topics forum</a>.</p>

    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p>I like music a lot. I like most types of music. I play the piano, mostly classical music.
    I also like maths, or just learning / getting challenged in general. That also explains my interest in programming.
    I like creative things (writing, drawing, etc.) too, but suck at most of them.</p>
